    "## Problem Statement and Introduction\n",
    "Water scarcity is a critical global issue, exacerbated by climate change and population growth. Agriculture, which consumes around 70% of freshwater resources, is heavily affected by inefficient irrigation practices that lead to water waste and reduced crop yields. Many farmers struggle with knowing when and how much to irrigate, often leading to either over-irrigation or under-irrigation, both of which harm crops and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, our team has developed an innovative Smart Irrigation System. This system leverages real-time IoT sensor data and weather forecasts to optimize irrigation schedules. It ensures crops receive just the right amount of water, reducing waste, promoting water conservation, and enhancing crop productivity. By automating irrigation decisions, we aim to help farmers manage water more efficiently, improving agricultural sustainability and resilience against climate change."

    "## Methodology and Key Features\n",
    "Our solution combines IoT technology with satellite imagery and weather forecasting to provide a comprehensive irrigation management system. In addition to using local sensors, we also leverage data from Copernicus and ArcGIS to derive information about soil moisture levels and past weather conditions from satellite imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-Time Monitoring: Soil and atmospheric conditions are continuously tracked via sensors.\n",
    "- Satellite Integration: Satellite imagery from Copernicus and ArcGIS provides additional insights into soil moisture and historical weather patterns.\n",
    "- Automated Decision-Making: The system automatically adjusts irrigation schedules based on sensor data, satellite-derived moisture levels, and weather forecasts.\n",
    "- Efficient Communication: LoRa and MQTT protocols enable long-range, low-power communication between the sensors, gateways, and cloud systems.\n",
    "- Weather-Driven Optimization: By factoring in past weather events and upcoming forecasts, the system avoids over-irrigation, especially when rain is expected."

    "## Functionality and Usage\n",
    "Here’s how the Smart Irrigation System works in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Collection: Field sensors collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, while satellite imagery from Copernicus and ArcGIS provides additional insights into larger-scale soil moisture conditions and weather patterns.\n",
    "2. Data Transmission: Using LoRa, the sensor data is sent to a gateway, which forwards it to the cloud via MQTT.\n",
    "3. Cloud Processing: The system pulls the last 24 hours of sensor readings and pairs them with satellite data and upcoming weather forecasts (e.g., rain predictions or temperature spikes).\n",
    "4. Decision Algorithm: Based on real-time and satellite data, the system determines whether irrigation is needed. If the soil moisture is low and no rain is forecast, it calculates the required irrigation time. Satellite data helps confirm large-scale soil moisture trends and historical weather events to fine-tune this decision.\n",
    "5. Automated Action: If irrigation is necessary, the system sends a command to irrigate for a specific duration, optimizing water usage based on both real-time and satellite-derived insights."
