# Smart Irrigation System - GAIAthon'24 Project ðŸŒ±

## Project Overview
This Smart Irrigation System was developed during GAIAthon'24, a hackathon organized by CERT in partnership with SUPCOM as part of the MarcNoWA research project. Our solution combines IoT technology with satellite imagery to create an intelligent irrigation management system that optimizes water usage in agriculture.

## Problem Statement
Water scarcity is a critical global issue, particularly affecting agriculture which consumes approximately 70% of freshwater resources. Traditional irrigation practices often lead to:

- Reduced crop yields
- Environmental impact through water waste
- Challenges in irrigation timing and quantity

## Our Solution
We developed a Smart Irrigation System that leverages:
- Real-time IoT sensor data
- Weather forecast integration

## Technologies Used

### Hardware Components
- Soil Moisture Sensors
- Air Temperature Sensors
- Air Humidity Sensors
- LoRa Gateway
